# Ai Art

### Vision Statement <br />
For people who want to play a guessing game on whether a piece of art is real or ai generated, and compare their scores to others.

### Application Description <br />
Our project will be a website in which the user plays a game where they have to determine whether or not the given piece of art is ai or not. We would have a database of real art and a database of ai generated art and one of these would randomly be generated on screen and the user would be prompted to decide whether or not it is a real piece of art or an ai generated piece of art. 

We would store statistics on each user that can be viewed on their profile page such as games played, high score, and other statistics like this. There would also be a global leaderboard where a user can compare their own scores to other players.
